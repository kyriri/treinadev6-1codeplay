# Codeplay - a web app for listing courses

[Campus Code](https://campuscode.com.br/) is a bootcamp school that trains jr web developers on behalf of partner companies. Their program called **Treinadev** happens 4-5 times a year, lasts 2.5 months, and selects around 20 students among those who complete some code challenges.

Codeplay is the first project for Treinadev 6 (May 2021): it's a Ruby on Rails web app.

Learning outcomes:
- starting a Rails project from scratch
- basic CRUD implementation
- introduction to Github's *Issues* and *Projects* functionality (the original assignment was published as a series of issues on the [Lesson's repo](https://github.com/TreinaDev/codeplay/issues))
